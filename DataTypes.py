#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
#Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
#The last line of your program should print the result.

second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

result = first_digit + second_digit
